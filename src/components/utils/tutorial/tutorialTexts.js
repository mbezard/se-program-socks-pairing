        During this tutorial I will present you my friends : the <b>Sock Sorter Bots</b>
        <br/>
        â˜º
        <br/>
        They are really kind, their only goal is to help you sort your socks

        <span>Behind me is the main menu</span>
        <br/>
        <span>You can select a sock collection on the <b>left</b> and a bot on the <b>right</b></span>
    </>,
    <>
        We don't have much choice right now, so choose the basic collection and the yellow bot
    </>,

        <div className={"my-3"}>
            You can see the modus operandi of a bot by clicking the <span
            className={"button-primary"}>Details</span> button
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div className={"mb-3"}>
            When you are ready, click on <span className={"button-primary"}>Execute</span> at the bottom of the screen
        </div>
